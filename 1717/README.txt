a.py: My initial solution for part 1.

a2.py: That solution would be too slow for part 2. Implement a new solution
with better asymptotic runtime before moving on to part 2.

b.py: The algorithm from a2.py applied to part 2.

b2.py: A faster solution for part 2.

b2_verbose.py: Just for fun: Visualizing what b2's algorithm looks like on the
example input.
